# Animation Tool
This is an animation tool (in-progress) that will aid in visualizing basic Computer Science algorithms such as Binary Search, up to Graph Algorithms.

The underlying goal of this project is to allow students who learn better via visuals to enhance their learning experience by simulating different algorithms with a multitude of 
different inputs.
